Bit manipulation is a fundamental programming technique that involves efficient operations on individual bits within binary data using bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOP, NOT, letf and right shift. It's indispensable for memory optimization, low-level hardware interaction, and algorithm design, making it essential skills for programmers.
